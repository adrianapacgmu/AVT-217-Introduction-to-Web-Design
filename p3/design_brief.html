	<h1>Design Brief and Art Work</h1><br><p>I'm a graphic designer, photographer and UX/UI designer therefore my website it's going be all about the presentation. Instead of including my resume I would like to focus more on my portfolio and my work. I would like to "experiment" with typography in my portfolio to make it more interesting and the color choice is going be limited. I do not want too bright colors in my websites. 
	My PAGES are going be:  <br>
	<section>  
	<ol>
		<li>Home Page</li>
		<li>Portfolio</li>
		<li>About Me</li>
		<li>Contact</li>
			
</ol>
	
</section>
I would like my portfolio to look organized, easy to ready and straight forward. The target audience is going be anyone in design world but I would like to also create website that can be easly understood by everyone else as well. It's going be all about design work as well as photography that I'm very passionate about.<br>
