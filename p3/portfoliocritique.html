<h2>Alessandro Scarpellini<br><br>

	</h2>



	<p>Alessandro's website is clean and organized and easy to read. I like how it's on the black backround without discrating images or colors. When you go to "About" section is written using bullet points which shows only the most important information about him without talking about his whole life that does not apply to design field. I noticed some designers like to talk about everything and nothing but not Alessandro.</p>



	



<h2>Grant Burke<br><br>

	<a href="https://www.grantburke.com/our-work/"><img src="2.jpg" alt="Grant Burke" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></a></h2>



	<p>I noticed my eye keeps going to portfolio websites with limited colors and clean look. I think that's what I always appreciate in design work. I do not like when there is chaos and images just everywhere. In Burke's website it can been seen organization and uniqueness. I like how he emphasized on the importance of recognizing the purpose of the website by having simle section "our work" and easy viewing his work by clicking on it.</p>



	



<h2>Tobias van Schneider<br><br>

	<p>There’s a real air of sophistication to its design, which showcases examples of his work in a restrained sideshow and offers a personal biography in bold type below. Comprehensive it is not, but you certainly get a clear sense of this creative’s personality and approach to his design work from this minimalist portfolio. </p>







<h2>Teodora Blindu<br><br>

	<p>For this example I would like to mention my sister-in-law. Her website is very personal and friendly. Her favoiurite color is yellow and as you can see she used that color for website's backround. Also, she added some photos of herself working with people and there are links in descriptions showing her work. Her portfolio is a little bit different then the ones I already included because her website seems to be simpler and more personalized. She is still working on the website but I think it's a good start. </p>



	

<h2>Robin Mastromarino<br><br>

	<p>Paris-based interface designer Robin Mastromarino keeps things fresh on his design portfolio site. An intriguing effect on his homepage makes the projects appear as though they're on a wheel, juddering into view with some satisfying UI animation touches. Within each case study, images also respond by warping slightly when you scroll. Although not appropriate for every creative, given that Mastromarino specialises in UI design this strikes all the right notes.</p>
