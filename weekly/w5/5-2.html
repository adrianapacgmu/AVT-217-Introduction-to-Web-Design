<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely <i>excited</i> about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <q>Cooking for Geeks</q>, Jeff Potter describes it as <em>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</em></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <cite>Sous Vide Salmon</cite> with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time></p>

<br> Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</br></p>
